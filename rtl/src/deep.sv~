 * Description: Main file for C-level simulator of our neural network. This 
 * file sets up the test image I/O, neural network tiles, and weight memory.
 * It also simulates training by gradient descent (backpropagation) of the NN.
 * The simulator has been made modular to allow us to experiment with different
 * system and neural network configurations before implementing the system on an
 * FPGA. This project is for our capstone design project 18-545 at Carnegie 
 * Mellon University.
